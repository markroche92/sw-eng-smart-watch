Diagram Descriptions : State Diagrams
=====================================

Display:
--------
The diagram describes how the different views of information are selected and activated. Once activated, the selected information is displayed to the user.

Entry point: Power-on of the device by holding Button A for 3 seconds. The initial activated view is Clock.

From an activated view, pressing Button B directs to the Display Selection menu. 
Pressing Button A while in display selection menu will allow the user to select the next view which can be activated.
Pressing Button B while a view is selected, will activate the view and display the selected information to the user.

Exit point: Button A & B are held for 3 seconds, while Display Selection menu is active, the device powers off.


Bluetooth:
----------
The diagram describes how the bluetooth connection to an external device is managed.

Entry point: When the device is powered on, the stored bluetooth setting (enabled / disabled) is loaded.

Once bluetooth is enabled by the user, a search begins for external bluetooth connections.
If a connection is found, and the watch has previously connected to this device, data transmission begins between the devices.
If a connection is found, and the watch has not previously connected to this device, the user is prompted to accept / reject connection with the device.
If the user accepts connection, data transmission begins between the devices. Otherwise, the search for bluetooth connections resumes.
If the user disables bluetooth, the above sequence resumes if the connection is later re-enabled.

Exit point: None currently... 

Settings:

Power Management:
-----------------
The diagram describes how the power mode of the device is managed.

Entry point: While powered off, the device is powered on by holding Button A for 3 seconds.
 
The Battery SoC is monitored, and determines state transitions. 
If an error occurs when reading SoC, a warning message is displayed to the user.
If battery SoC is found to be > 2%, the device will operate within ether Full Power of Low Power mode.
Transition between these two states is also determined by accelerometer readings.
Reduced device functionality is available while in Low Power mode, compared with Full Power mode. 

Exit point: Once SoC drops below 2%, the device powers off, or if device is manually deactivated by the user.
